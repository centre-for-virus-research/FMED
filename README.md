# Flu Mutation Effect Database

GitHub provides a collaborative platform for tracking influenza mutations and their associated phenotypes by utilizing its issue tracking system. Researchers can submit new mutations identified from scientific publications, including details about the mutation, phenotypic effects, and references to the experimental approach. This approach allows for the creation of a centralized, open-access repository where mutation data is updated, discussed, and refined by contributors worldwide.

By leveraging GitHub's version control and issue tracking, the repository ensures transparency and real-time updates as mutations are reported and discussed. Researchers worldwide can contribute to the database, reviewing mutations and suggesting further experiments. Automated tools can also be used to streamline the submission process, making GitHub an efficient and scalable solution for managing influenza mutation data.
